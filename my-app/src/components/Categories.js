// people never run into the problems of scaling state management with local state (this.state) only
// thus people don't understand the need of a state management library like Redux
// thus people complain that it adds too much boilerplate
// people never learn to manage local state in React
// thus people will manage (and clutter) all of their state in a state container provided by Redux
// thus people never use the local state management
// Because of these drawbacks, you will often get the advice to learn React first and opt-in Redux to your tech stack 
// in a later point in time. But only opt-in Redux if you run into issues scaling your state management. 
// These scaling issues only apply for larger applications. 


// So, what problems could this component have? 
// Both the logic and the view are intertwined in one indivisible component,
// and that's why I also call this pattern the Mixed Component pattern. 
// For a better workflow and simpler, more testable and more maintainable code, 
// we need to separate the logic and the view
